# C++ projects
Various C++ projects that I work on here and there in my free time, mostly as I learn to program.

## User Registration
The **userRegistration** was the first c++ project that I decided to do, mostly for fun, as well as to practice a proper lower-level language.
It still needs some work with user registration, especially in regard to encrypting/decrypting the user-info, but the process works.
The idea was that after registration, the user can then access various tools and mini-proojects that I would make. Eventually I moved on to other projects, but implementing them won't be too difficult (e.g., I have made many tic-tac-toes in different languages, and really couldn't stand doing another one, this time in C++).

## Gui Calculator
The **GuiCalculator** was my first gui project I had done, and I had used wxwidgets. I made this a few months into my programming journey, and looking at it now, it is very barebones! I would have much preferred using ASCII codes to determine the inputs, and used vectors to perform the calculations, but instead, I took a beginner's approach of "many functions for many things!". It also only works with integers as inputs, while giving a float as the result. I might touch this up at some point to ensure it works properly.

## Console RPG
The **ConsoleRPG** was a tutorial-based project that I followed along with. Ihave done many of these early one until I found out they don't lend to proper learning, so I scrapped most of them, but this one I kept because - in my opinion - it shows that I have done some OOP
