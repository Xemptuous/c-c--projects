# C++ projects
Various C++ projects that I work on here and there in my free time, mostly as I learn to program.

## User Registration
The **userRegistration** was the first c++ project that I decided to do, mostly for fun, as well as to practice a proper lower-level language. The menu items are not fully implemented.

## Gui Calculator
The **GuiCalculator** was my first gui project I had done, and I had used wxwidgets. I made this a few months into my programming journey. I am still working on it from time to time, trying to improve it where I can.

## Console RPG
The **ConsoleRPG** was a tutorial-based project that I followed along with. I have done many of these early one until I found out they don't lend to proper learning, so I scrapped most of them, but this one I decided to keep.
